# Library Management System

## Overview

The **Library Management System** is a full-stack application built with the **MEAN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js). It is designed to efficiently manage library operations, including book records, member registrations, and borrowing/return processes. The frontend uses **NgRx** for state management, and the entire project is containerized with **Docker**.
